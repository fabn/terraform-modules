# Can be tweaked to avoid printing output as your preference into .lefthook.local.yml
# skip_output:
  # - execution      # Skips printing any execution logs (but prints if the execution failed)
  # - execution_out  # Skips printing execution output (but still prints failed commands output)  -
  # - execution_info # Skips printing `EXECUTE > ...` logging
